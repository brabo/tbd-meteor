# [tbd] API

## get all routes via:
#### curl -k https://tbd.camp/publications/api-routes

## login

POST /users/login, POST /users/register

#### curl https://tbd.camp/users/login -d "username=test&password=123456"
#### curl https://tbd.camp/users/register -d "username=test&email=test@domain.net&password=123456"


The login and registration endpoints take the same inputs. Pass an object with the following properties:

- username
- email
- password

password is required, and you must have at least one of username or email.

##### even though you can create an account without an email, it makes it easier for us to reach you in case of subbmission changes. It's also needed to reset your password. We will never send spam, promise ;)

---

## Responses

Both login and registration have the same response format.

successful response:
#### {  token: "string",  tokenExpires: "ISO encoded date string",  id: "user id" }

error response:
#### { error: "error-code", reason: "Human readable error string" }

---

## Authenticated Calls

For any endpoints that require the default authentication, you must include the userId and authToken with each request under the following headers:

- X-User-Id
- X-Auth-Token

#### curl -H "X-Auth-Token: f2KpRW7KeN9aPmjSZ" -H "X-User-Id: fbdpsNf4oHiX79vMJ" https://tbd.camp/orders/

## all routes (as of writing):
##### if you just want to fetch, concentrate on the /publications/ routes
